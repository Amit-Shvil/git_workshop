#### adding github code search to your chorme 
sorry, these are a bit Wix specific, but can be changed to work for you too! (just change the user:wix to your favourite user)

1. in chrome, right click the url bar
2. choose "Edit Search Engines".
3. In "Other Search Engines", go to the end and you'll see 3 empty boxes:
  * in the first enter whatever you want, it's just a name for you. e.g., github code search
  * in the second enter a keyword that will be used to access this search engine. e.g., github. 
  * in the third, use this (don't include the dashes!) 'https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&type=Code&q=user:wix %s'
4. click "Done".
5. now go to your url bar and write 'github BootstrapServer' (again, no dashes!)
6. Enjoy!
