# git workshop
a workshop on git - how to create your PRs so others can merge them easily.

## Before You Start
Because we want everyone to use the same repository, We want each team to have its own file in the repository.
what we want in the end:
* a fork for each team
* a file in the user_data folder for each team, commited to master branch in both fork and original repository

the instructions below will help you do it with using only github:

1. fork this repository to your user by clicking the <a href="#before-you-start"><img src="https://github.com/nadavwe/git_workshop/raw/master/.readme/user_data_plus.png" height="15" title="Fork" alt="Fork" align="center"/></a> button in the right side of the screen.
2. in the new fork, open the user_data folder.
1. Click the '+' sign where it says <a href="#before-you-start"><img src="https://github.com/nadavwe/git_workshop/raw/master/.readme/user_data_plus.png" height="15" title="git_workshop/+" alt="git_workshop/+" align="center"/></a>.
1. give your file the name of your team (or any other identifying name of your choice). try to make it special so there won't be clashes. also write some text in your file.
2. commit the file into master.
3. you're now back at the main repository page. in the gray bar, click <a href="#before-you-start"><img src="https://github.com/nadavwe/git_workshop/raw/master/.readme/pull_request.png" height="15" title="pull request" alt="pull request" align="center"/></a>.
2. now click <a id="pull" href="#before-you-start"><img src="https://github.com/nadavwe/git_workshop/raw/master/.readme/create_pull_request.png" height="15" title="create pull request" alt="create pull request" align="center"/></a>, and then click again on the button near the bottom of the page.

you're finished! thanks for doing this first before anything else. =)
